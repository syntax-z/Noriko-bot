## What to Contribute

including but not limited to:

- **New Features**: Have an idea for a new feature that would be a good fit for the bot? Implement it and submit a pull request.
- **Prompts**: Noriko's character could use more fine-tuning, if you have a better prompt that might improve it, submit a pull request!
- **Bug Fixes**: If you notice a bug and know how to fix it, your help is appreciated here as well.

## Contribution Guidelines

Before you submit your contribution, **please ensure the following:**

#### Testing:
- Submit pull requests in the `features` branch
- DO NOT submit changes without first testing them. (This also includes prompts)
- When using GPT prompts DO NOT use chatGPT to test your prompts, instead use the API directly.
- If you have a big change you want to implement, please split them up in multiple pull requests, this makes it more managable to review.

#### Code Style
- Functions/methods/classes that are at least 11 lines long should be separated from another method by 4 spaces

#### Commit Messages

- Try to write commit messages that provide context for the changes you've made.
- Pull request descriptions should give a detailed note of your changes in the pull request.
