To exit, you need to type  `<n_end_chat>`\n- **DMS:** You can start talking by simply sending a message in dms\n- **talk:** You can type `/talk <chat_name>` to create a private thread where u can start a conversation\n## AI Info\n- **Ratelimits:** By default when speaking to Noriko you are using Google's PaLM API which a has a ratelimit of 90 requests per minute, meaning if 90 messages are sent within a minute by anyone, the bot will error for u.\nTo avoid this issue you can use ur own API key (which is free to get if using PaLM as of writing this). Type `/setup`"
