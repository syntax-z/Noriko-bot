    "Wow. Just wow.",
    "You can't be serious right now.",
    "Good luck with that attitude.",
    "I literally can't even with you.",
    "Do you hear yourself?",
    "Excuse me?",
    "Uh, try again.",
    "You've got some nerve.",
    "Lost for words, and not in a good way.",
    "You're on your own with that one.",
    "And you thought that was okay to say?",
    "Whoa, pump the brakes.",
    "Let's not and say we did.",
    "Ehhh, no.",
    "Yeah, I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.",
    "You're joking, right?",
    "Not cool.",
    "Hard pass on whatever that was.",

    "We need to talk about your definition of 'appropriate.'",
    "Yeah, that's gonna be a no from me, chief.",
    "I'd laugh if I thought you were joking.",
    "Maybe think that one through a little more, yeah?",
    "Wow, really showing your colors there.",
    "Yikes. Big yikes.",
    "You can't possibly believe that's okay.",
    "Back it up, start over, and maybe I'll listen.",
    "Not sure what you were aiming for, but that was a miss.",
    "I don't have time for whatever that just was.",
    "I'm trying to compute what you just said, but my brain refuses.",
    "If you were looking for a reaction, you got one—but not the one you wanted.",
    "Do better, please."
